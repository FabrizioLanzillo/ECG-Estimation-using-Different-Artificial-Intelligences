# ECG-Estimation-using-Different-Artificial-Intelligences
University project for the *Intelligent Systems* course (MSc Computer Engineering) by Fabrizio Lanzillo, Federico Montini e Riccardo Sagramoni.

Design and implementation of several **artificial intelligences** (MLP, RBFN, FIS, CNN, RNN) on a dataset composed of biophysical signals.

Developed with **MATLAB** (2022a version).

# How to run
- Download the repository and the dataset compressed folder.
- Unpack the dataset and put the csv files in a folder named `dataset` at the root level of the repository.
- Open MATLAB in the `src` folder and execute the `set_path.m` script.
- ***Warning!***: Execute all the MATLAB scripts inside the subfolders from the src folder (otherwise all the paths are broken).

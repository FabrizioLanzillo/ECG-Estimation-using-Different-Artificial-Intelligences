# Recurrent Neural Network for ECG forecasting
Execute `generate_data_rnn.m` and then `rnn_one_step.m` to generate, train and test a RNN that estimates the next value of the ECG.

Execute `generate_data_rnn.m`, `rnn_multi_step.m` and then `forecast_multi_step.m` in this order to generate, train and test a RNN that estimates the next five values of the ECG.

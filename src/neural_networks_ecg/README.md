# TASK 3.1 & 3.2: Neural Networks for fitting and classification
This folder contains the scripts to generate, train and test the following networks:
- An **multi-layer perceptron network** which takes the features as input and estimates the mean/std of the ecg signal (folder `fitting_NN`).
- A **radial-basis function network** which takes the features as input and estimates the mean/std of the ecg signal (folder `fitting_RBF`).
- An **multi-layer perceptron network** which classify the input into three categories (folder `classification`).

## How to prepare data before of training
After extracting the features with the scripts of `..\feature_extraction` folder, execute the script `analyze_sequentialfs_results.m`

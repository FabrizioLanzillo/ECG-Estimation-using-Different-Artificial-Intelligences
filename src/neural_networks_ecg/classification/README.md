# Multi-Layer Perceptron network for Person's Activity Determination

Execute `training_br.m` to generate, train and test a MLP that determinates a person's activity using the Bayesian Regularization as training function.

Execute `training_lm.m` to generate, train and test a MLP that determinates a person's activity using the Levenberg-Marquardt as training function.

Execute `training_scg.m` to generate, train and test an MLP that determinate a person's activity using the Scaled Conjugate Gradient as training function.

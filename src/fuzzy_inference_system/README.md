# TASK 3.3: Fuzzy Inference System
- Run `select_best_features.m` to select the three best features for the classification problem (they will be used to build the FIS).
- Run `generate_histograms.m` to generate histograms according to the data distribution of the selected features.
- Run `test_designed_fis.m` to test the fuzzy inference system saved into `results/fis.fis`, i.e. the FIS file created with the *Fuzzy Logic Designer* tool.
- Run `generate_and_tune_fis.m` to automatically generate, tune and test a TSK fuzzy inference system with ANFIS approach.
